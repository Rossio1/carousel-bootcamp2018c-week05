# My Image Carousel
For my image carousel I made a slideshow with 7 photos that were able to loop around by clicking the previous or next button and also works by clicking the left and right arrow keys.

First I created an HTML for the page. 
Then I named my document and proceeded by adding the images I wanted to be displayed.
Next I added the onclick function to allow the buttons to reacted when previous or next were clicked on.
I also set if conditions so the images would loop after the last image was displayed and for when the arrow keys were pressed. Finally I styled the carousel using CSS.
