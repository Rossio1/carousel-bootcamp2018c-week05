# My Image Carousel
For my image carousel I made a slideshow with 7 photos that were able to loop around by clicking the previous or next button and also works by pressing the left and right arrow keys.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Then I named my document and proceeded by adding the images I wanted to be displayed.
Next I added the onclick function to allow the buttons to react when the previous or next buttons were clicked on.
I also set an if condition statement for when the images would loop after the last image was displayed or when the first imasge was set to continue in the loop.

# Optimizations

Still a work in progress.

# Lessons Learned:
For this project I learned how make a loop with images as well as how to impliment the keypress function
